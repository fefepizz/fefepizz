- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fefepizz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI, cooking and many other random things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Information Engineering and I hope I will learn some more Machine Learning after my bachelor's degree 
- âš¡ Fun fact: If engineering does't work out for me I think the best choice would be a ramen shop
