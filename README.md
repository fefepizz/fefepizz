- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fefepizz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in HPC, AI, 3D printing, Sim Racing, cooking and many other things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Information Engineering and I'm planning to enroll in HPC Engineering after my bachelor's degree .
- âš¡ Fun fact: If engineering does't work out for me I would like to give a shot to opening a ramen shop.
